Oranje Chess has moved to a new site!  It has a new blog with my own stories about chess learning, resources and the progress to growth chess in Australian schools and communities.  Also, when it is in season, chess game analysis and coverage of __local__, __national__, and international chess events. READMORE

### [Wiik aan Zee](http://www.tatasteelchess.com/)

With a new year upon us, there is plenty of international chess tourneys to watch if you like Grandmaster chess. Ongoing is the [famous tourney from Wiik aan Zee, called Tata Steel] (http://www.tatasteelchess.com/) which features dozens of the top GMs.  

### [Zurich Chess Challenge]( http://www.zurich-cc.com/)

Also to come is the [Zurich Chess Challenge] ( http://www.zurich-cc.com/) at the end of the month, which is the strongest chess tourney to date with an average rating of 2801!  World Champion Carlsen, Anand, Naka, Aronian are all
there, so check it out on [FICS](htttp://www.freechess.org) or one of the many other chess sites like [Chess.com](http://www.chess.com).  

### [Australia Chess Championships](http://auschesschamps.com/)

Back at home, the Aussie chess championships were held at the start of the year and attracted a good mix of locals, including Queenslanders IM Stephen Solomon and Brodie McClymont, and internationals.  Have a look at some of the games as there was some real tactical fireworks.  

### OranjeChess on Chess.com

I'll be starting a chess.com membership to provide games and analysis from, so all my own games are available and documenting how I go about using the site, among other resources, to play and improve chess largely for free.

That's all for now!
